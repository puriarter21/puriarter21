Hello! I'm Pablo Uriarte, a Master's student at the Government School of Tecnol√≥gico de Monterrey, where I also work at their Data Science Center as a Research Assistant. At the same time I collaborate with professor Phd, Jose Ramirez Marquez from Steven's Institute of Technology.

Research Project:  Mapa_Migracion_Irregular_Mexicorregula/Assesing Vulnerability - Draft.pdf
Check out my draft research article titled Assessing Vulnerability Due to Infrastructure Capacity and Insecurity in Irregular Migration Routes: An Institutional Evaluation of the Mexico-U.S. Corridor. In this project, I utilize data processing tools mainly in Python, such as; Pandas, Geopandas, matlibplot, etc. And ArcGIS to create a graph network that represents the vulnerabilities faced by irregular migrants traveling through Mexico.

I'm currently working in some projects related to data analysis, Natural Language Processing (NLP), GIS data ecosystems, and data visualization. I code primarly in Python and R, and im adept to learn new coding languages. I have practical knowledge of database administration, where I have efficiently managed and organized vast datasets. Beyond administration, I excel at extracting insights from data sets, to support decision-making processes, and driving development strategies. I'm passionate about continuous learning and the application of data science to solve complex problems. Feel free to connect with me or explore my projects!

Im open to collaborate in exciting new projects.
