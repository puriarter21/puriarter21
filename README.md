Hello! I'm Pablo Uriarte, a Master's student at the Government School of Tecnol√≥gico de Monterrey, where I also collaborate with the Data Science Center.

Research Project:  Mapa_Migracion_Irregular_Mexicorregula/Assesing Vulnerability - Draft.pdf
Check out my draft research article titled Assessing Vulnerability Due to Infrastructure Capacity and Insecurity in Irregular Migration Routes: An Institutional Evaluation of the Mexico-U.S. Corridor. In this project, I utilize data processing tools mainly in Python, such as; Pandas, Geopandas, matlibplot, etc. And ArcGIS to create a graph network that represents the vulnerabilities faced by irregular migrants traveling through Mexico.

I'm currently working in some projects related to data analysis, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and data visualization, primarily using Python and R. I have practical knowledge of database administration, where I have efficiently managed and organized vast datasets. Beyond administration, I excel at extracting meaningful insights from data, supporting decision-making processes, and driving strategic development. I'm passionate about continuous learning and the application of data science to solve complex problems. Feel free to connect with me or explore my projects!
