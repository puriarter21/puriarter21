I am a Master’s candidate in Public Administration and Public Policy at the Tecnológico de Monterrey, School of Government and Public Transformation, with a graduation date in November 2024. For two years, I worked as a research assistant at the Data Science Center of this same institution, where I performed data analysis and cleaning for projects involving natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML), among others.

I recently completed a research stay with Dr. José Ramírez Márquez at Stevens Institute of Technology, working on a project analyzing vulnerabilities in irregular migration routes in Mexico. In this project, I efficiently used tools such as ArcGIS Pro, as well as GeoPandas and Matplotlib in Python, to map migration flows and the associated vulnerabilities along the North American migration corridor, while managing geographic databases. Additionally, I have basic knowledge in other programming languages such as R and Jav. As well as good proficiency in data visualization software like Tableau and PowerBI, and advanced knowledge of Excel.
