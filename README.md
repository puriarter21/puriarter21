Hello there! I am Pablo Uriarte, currently pursuing my Master's degree at the Government School of Tec de Monterrey. Where, I am also a collaborator at their Data Science Center, which allows me to hone my skills and contribute to the data science community.

I am presently immersing myself in an array of projects related to data analysis, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and data visualization, utilizing Python and R as my primary languages.

My expertise also extends to database administration, where I efficiently handle and organize vast quantities of data. Beyond the administration, I excel at uncovering meaningful insights from data, aiding decision-making processes, and driving the development of strategies.

I am enthusiastic about continual learning and the application of data science to solve complex problems. Feel free to connect with me or check out my projects!
